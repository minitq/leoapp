A Private Auction on Aleo
Summary
A first-price sealed-bid auction (or blind auction) is a type of auction in which each participant submits a bid without knowing the bids of the other participants. The bidder with the highest bid wins the auction.

In this model, there are two parties: the auctioneer and the bidders.

Bidder: A participant in the auction.
Auctioneer: The party responsible for conducting the auction.
We make following assumptions about the auction:

The auctioneer is honest. That is, the auctioneer will resolve all bids in the order they are received. The auctioneer will not tamper with the bids.
There is no limit to the number of bids.
The auctioneer knows the identity of all bidders, but bidders do not necessarily know the identity of other bidders.
Under this model, we require that:

Bidders do not learn any information about the value of other bids.
